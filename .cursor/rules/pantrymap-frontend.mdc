# PantryMap Frontend Constraints

You are modifying PantryMap frontend.

## Hard constraints

1. **Do NOT** change PantryAPI baseURL selection logic (Azure-first + fallback).
2. **Do NOT** change pantryId normalization logic or how pantryId is passed to API calls.
3. **Do NOT** change donations endpoint contract:
   - POST /api/donations
   - GET /api/donations?pantryId=<string>&page=<number>&pageSize=<number>
4. **Do NOT** introduce local-only persistence (localStorage/IndexedDB) for donations, wishlist, or messages.
5. Any UI refactor must keep network requests identical (same URL, method, query params, payload shape).

## Before finishing

- Verify in code where donations GET/POST are called and ensure they still call the same endpoints with the same parameters.
- Only update UI rendering and styling. Do not touch API layer (`api.js`) or request logic.
